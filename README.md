# Testsuite for Compiler Praktikum at IPD Snelting

Lacks a lot of tests, because students are supposed to create them
on their own.
Includes the [sisyphus](https://github.com/libfirm/sisyphus) test runner
as a submodule.

Requires Python 2.

To execute the tests, enter this directory and:

    sisyphus/sis --compiler=<your_executable>

Of course, you have to tell it, how your compiler is named.
It expects to find it on the PATH.
