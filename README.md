Testsuite for Compiler Praktikum at IPD Snelting

Lacks a lot of tests, because students are supposed to create them
on their own. Include sisyphus test runner.

To execute the tests, enter this directory and:

    sisyphus/sis --compiler=<your_executable>

Of course, you have to tell it, how your compiler is named.
It expects to find it on the PATH.
